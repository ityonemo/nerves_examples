# Hello Scenic

This example demonstrates a basic project using [Scenic](https://github.com/ScenicFramework/scenic) using the [scenic_driver_local](https://github.com/ScenicFramework/scenic_driver_local) backend to display scenes on a local display of a target device or to a window on the host.

The example has a [scene](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves-examples/blob/main/hello_scenic/lib/scenes/home.ex) that just draws a couple of basic shapes, shows an analog clock, "Hello" and "World", and the cursor position, button and scroll events.
